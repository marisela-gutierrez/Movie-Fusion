# Movie Fusion

AS A movie/tv lover
I want to be able to search for movies and tv shows
SO that I can see what platform they stream on
AND the information about them

The Movie Fusion webpage is a responsive site that allows you to search through movies, TV shows and actors in order to get detailed information and find out where they are available to be streamed.  It also allows users to save their favorite movie or show to a favorites page for reference later.  The navbar is the same across all the pages allowing users to return home to search for additional shows or go to their favorites list.  On mobile devices, the nav links will reduce down to a hamburger menu.

The main landing page has a search bar to find your desired movie, TV show or actor/actress.  The results will display below in the form of either a movie/tv poster image with the title or a headshot with a name.  The shows will also have an option to save directly to the favorites which is stored on local storage.  There is a check on all save to favorites buttons to see if the title is already in you favorites list, and if it is, the button changes to a remove from favorites.  The images and titles/names act as links to other webpages to get more information about either the movie/TV show or actor/actress. 

The movie page will display all the associated information about a selected movie or TV show and also have a save to favorites button.  A larger poster image will display as well as the title, the date release (in the case of TV shows, the date it ended as well), the length (for TV shows, it will show the number of seasons, total number of episodes and avg runtime), and a description.  Below that it will display what streaming options are available to view the show on.  It will check against Netflix, Hulu, HBO Max, Amazon Prime and Disney Plus and supply a link to the applicable site directed to that show.  If it is not available on any of these services, a link will be provided to TMBD which has additional streaming or rental services that it might be available on.  Below that, it will display the cast of the show using the same display function as the search page with links to more information about that actor.

The actors page will give more detailed information about the actor or actress including a larger headshot, their name, their birthday, and a bio.  Below their information, it will also display other movies or TV shows that they are known for.  These images will allow you to immediately save to local storage or go to the associated information page.

The favorites page will pull all your saved favorite titles from local storage and display their posters and titles with the option to remove them from the favorites list.  If clicked on, you will go to that movie or TV shows information page.
